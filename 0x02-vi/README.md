**Day-0-Project-2**

This folder contains all the practice done using vi in the first project of the zeroth day of the ALX program. 
The main tool used here is vi. 
Including this readme file all of the files have been written using vi. 

In each of the files found in this directory lies the vi command to do what is mentioned in the file name.

*For example:*

If a file is named 0-opening then inside this file lies the command for opening
a file in emacs (**C-x b**), as mentioned in the documentation
