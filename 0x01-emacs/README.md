**Day-0-Project-1**

This folder contains all the practice done using emacs in the first project of the zeroth day of the ALX program. 
The main tool used here is emacs. 
Including this readme file all of the files have been written using emacs. 

In each of the files found in this directory lies the emacs command to do what is mentioned in the file name as written in the Emac's documentation.

*For example:*

If a file is named 0-opening then inside this file lies the command for opening
a file in emacs (**C-x b**), as mentioned in the documentation
